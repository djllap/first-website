	    <h2>A Dino History</h2>
	    <p>The history of Dinosaurs is, perhaps, the largest source of false 'facts' that are so popularly clung to.  It is popular belief that Dinosaurs evolved over millenia from lower creatures, and then disappeared equally slowly by evolving into avian species.  This couldn't be more wrong.  The truth is that Dinosaurs traveled to Earth on a space ship.  That's right: Dinosaurs are aliens.</p>

	    <p>The Dinosaurs did not disappear by evolving into birds either.  Most scientists agree that after thousands of years on earth, the Dinosaurs must have had an incredibly bad hangover.  It is most likely that the tipsy Dinosaurs stumbled back to their flying saucers and left Earth for their home planet.</p>
      <p>But then why have they not returned in all the years since?  There are many different theories.  Some think that the Dinosaurs got married and had children, so they no longer have time for Earth parties.  Some think that they finally admitted to their drinking problem and now spend all their time together in group sessions.  But the most probably explanation is that piloting flying saucers while drunk is not a smart thing to do, and the Dinosaurs all crashed into a planet somewhere.  Or perhaps a star.</p>

	    <p>Dinosaurs do <em>not</em> get along well with unicorns.  If you ever see these two creatures in the same room, you'd better run for it.  If it happens to be a winged unicorn all you can do is pray.</p>
