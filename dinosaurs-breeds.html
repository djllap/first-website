        <h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>
        <p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex was the king of the Dinosaurs.  He is much beloved due to his large head and small arms.  Scientists are unsire wether his abnormally small arms were normal or some kind of birth defect.  In any case, he had a very hard time scratching his back.</p>
        <p>Pictured here is the rare Tyroundasaurus, a variant of the Tyrannosaurus.  It is categorized by the way it rolls around for transportation.  It has even been known to hunt by squashing its prey under its massive bulk.</p>

        <h3>Dome Head</h3>
        <p>The Dome Head Dinosaur stood as tall as your average full size poodle.  Many think that This pint sized critter must have been trying to compensate for something when it decided to grow a large thick plate of exoskeleton on its head.  It used this exoskeleton to bash its head against other Dome Heads as a ovverly masculine-greeting, and to crush beer cans.</p>
        <p>There are no good pictures of the Dome Head on the internet for me to steal, so I put up a picture of a dome instead.  Just imagine it on the head of a bipedal Dinosaur and you'll get the gist of it.</p>
